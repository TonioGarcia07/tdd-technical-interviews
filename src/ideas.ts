 *
 * One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on
 * strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character.
 * Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit
 * (or zero edits) away.
 *
 * ************************************************************************
 *
 * String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string
 * compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example,
 * the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3, If the "compressed"
 * string would not become smaller than the original string, your method
 * should return the original string. You can assume the string has only
 * uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).
